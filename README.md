# Almighty Algorithm

Algorithm used for MDP Project, AY2014/15 Semester 2.
- Done in Java using javax.swing
- Using A* for pathfinding
- Only feature worth mentioning is the idea of 'Assigning weights to different sensors', giving better weightage to sensors that are more accurate

<p>
(Once upon a time, assumed to be the) Best algorithm ever! (Obviously not true though)
